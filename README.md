## Why the IBM Telco Dataset?

This project is built on the [IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cognos-analytics/11.1.0?topic=samples-telco-customer-churn), originally released by **IBM** for use in their **Cognos Analytics enterprise BI platform**

This synthetic, enterprise-grade dataset was designed by IBM to mirror real-world customer, billing, and service patterns within a telecom provider.

âœ… By leveraging this dataset, the project aligns with actual enterprise BI workflows and demonstrates skills that translate directly to consulting, strategy, and executive-facing analytics roles.
