# Executive-Intelligence (Telco Turnaround Simulator)


**Great strategy starts with clarity ‚Äî not just data.**  

This project simulates how executives can use predictive insights, ROI modeling, and targeted actions to reverse business decline and drive smarter decisions.

It blends business intelligence, data science, and executive thinking into a strategic decision-support system designed to guide action, not just observation.

Built on IBM‚Äôs enterprise-grade customer dataset, the simulator empowers decision-makers to:
- Predict churn before it happens
- Simulate the ROI of targeted retention spend
- Identify high-value, at-risk segments
- Take action ‚Äî not just analyze

While the dataset simulates a telecom provider, the strategic approach ‚Äî churn prediction, CLTV analysis, and ROI modeling ‚Äî applies broadly across subscription-driven industries.

So whether you‚Äôre in telecom, SaaS, or any subscription-driven business, this project shows how to connect insights to impact.

## Why the IBM Telco Dataset?

This project is built on the [IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cognos-analytics/11.1.0?topic=samples-telco-customer-churn), originally released by **IBM** for use in their **Cognos Analytics enterprise BI platform**

This synthetic, enterprise-grade dataset was designed by IBM to mirror real-world customer, billing, and service patterns within a telecom provider.

By leveraging this dataset, the project aligns with actual enterprise BI workflows and demonstrates skills that translate directly to consulting, strategy, and executive-facing analytics roles.


## Live Tableau Dashboards

- [**Executive Intelligence Dashboard**](https://public.tableau.com/views/telcosimulatore/ExecutiveDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  
  A top-level executive summary of customer churn metrics, lifetime value, and contract risk segmentation.

- [**Revenue Risk and Retention Strategy Simulator**](https://public.tableau.com/views/telcosimulatore2/SimulatorDashboard?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)  
  A dynamic simulator to model saved revenue and net ROI based on retention spend ‚Äî powered by logistic regression modeling and interactive parameters.
